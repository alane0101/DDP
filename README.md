## How to Use "MPG Calculator"

These are instructions for using the "MPG Calculator" app. Since the application is running on a Shiny cloud server, you need not deploy it elsewhere.

Please follow the Shiny [link](https://alane0101.shinyapps.io/DDP_course_proj/) to the app. 

Once the app is open in your browser:

* Use the slider to set your vehicle's weight in pounds (lbs).
* Use the dropdown menu to set the number of cylinders
* Click "Submit"
